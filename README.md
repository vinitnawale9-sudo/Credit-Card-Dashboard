Credit Card Transaction Dashboard

The Credit Card Transaction Dashboard is an interactive analytics solution designed to provide a comprehensive overview of credit card usage, revenue generation, and transaction behavior across multiple dimensions. This dashboard transforms large-scale transaction data into actionable insights for financial analysis and decision-making.

At a high level, the dashboard highlights key performance indicators, including Total Revenue (57M), Total Transaction Amount (46M), Total Interest Earned (8M), and Total Transaction Count (667K). These KPIs offer an instant snapshot of overall business performance. Quarterly performance is visualized using a combined bar and line chart, showing revenue trends alongside transaction volume across Q1–Q4, enabling quick comparison of growth patterns over time.

The dashboard allows users to analyze revenue by card category (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum), clearly revealing that Blue cards contribute the highest share of revenue. A detailed table further breaks down revenue, transaction amount, and interest earned by card type for deeper analysis. Additional insights are provided through expenditure-type analysis, including swipe, chip, and online transactions, as well as spending categories such as bills, entertainment, fuel, grocery, travel, and food.

Customer segmentation is another key focus area. Revenue is analyzed across education levels, professions, and income groups, helping identify high-value customer segments. Interactive slicers for quarter, week start date, gender, card category, and income level allow users to dynamically filter the data and customize insights based on specific criteria.

Overall, this dashboard demonstrates strong capabilities in data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling. It serves as an effective tool for monitoring financial performance, understanding customer behavior, and identifying revenue-driving segments, making it well-suited for portfolio presentation, academic projects, or real-world financial analytics use cases.
